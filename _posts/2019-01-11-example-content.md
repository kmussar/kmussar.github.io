##  Optimizing Marketing at New York MTA Stations

### Metis Project #1



The goal of this project was to identify the optimal stations to place street teams in order to recruit people to attend a fictioal women in technology gala. 

The gala was to take place in New York City in the early summer and we were to use the MTA turnstile data in our analysis. 



## Approach

1. Define target audience

2. Identify stations used by the target audience

3. Within our filtered stations, choose those with the highest volume of traffic.  



### Target Audience 

We assumed that the following groups would be likely to attend a women in technology gala: 

* Women working in technology fields

* Other genders working in technology fields

* Women employed in other fields

* Students



## The Data

To complete this project, we used the following 5 data sources: 

* NYC Open Data's [Demographics and profiles at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographics-and-profiles-at-the-Neighborhood-Tabu/hyuz-tij8) 

* NYC Open Data's [NTA Map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NTA-map/d3qk-pfyz/data) 

* NYC Open Data's [Subway Stations Map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49/data) 

* [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)

* NYC's [MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) 



## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Determine which neighborhoods our target audience lives, works, or goes to school in. 



### Idenfity the MTA subway stations that are located in these neighborhoods



### Calculate the volume of traffic for each subway station. 



### Filter 



## Our recommendations



## Challenges & Future Directions

* Automatically determine which neighborhood a station is in. 

* Explore other demographic data for potential attendees

* Optimize recommendations for day of week and time of day 



* Use feedback collected from initial test runs to inform the future runs. 

* Use online resources such as Meetup.com and LinkedIn to promote the event.
